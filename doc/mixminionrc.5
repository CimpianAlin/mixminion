.Nm mixminionrc
.Nd Mixminion client configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa $HOME/.mixminionrc
.It Pa $HOME/mixminionrc
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm mixminion
reads its configuration first from the command line, then from its
configuration file, then from its built-in defaults.  To find a configuration
file, the software looks:
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
In the configuration file specified with the command-line
.Fl f | Fl \-config
flag, if any.
.It
.Pa $HOME/.mixminionrc
.It
.Pa $HOME/mixminionrc
.El
.Pp
If
.Nm mixminion
starts with no available configuration file, it creates one in the default
location.
.Pp
The file itself is line-based, with lines grouped into sections.  Blank line
and lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments.  All section headings
and entries must appear in the first column.
.Pp
Each non-comment line is either a section header, of the format
"[SectionName]", or an entry of the format "Key: Value".  All names are
case-sensitive.  Unless otherwise noted, sections and entries may appear in
any order, but no section or entry may appear more than once.
.Pp
We describe the recognized entry keys below, grouped by section.
