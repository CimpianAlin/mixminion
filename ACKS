   Special thanks go to Christopher Porter, whose donation of a copy
   of Visual Studio 6 made the first native Windows port possible;
   and to the as-now anonymous donor who got me an MSDN subscription
   to make the Windows port better.

   Finally, thanks to George Danezis and the whole Mixminion-Dev team
   for their work on the Type III remailer design.
